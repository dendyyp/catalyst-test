Here are some feature suggestions for the Jamtangan.com website:

- Virtual Try-On for Watches
  - Implement a virtual try-on feature that allows users to visualize how a watch will look on their wrist using augmented reality (AR).
  - Enhance the online shopping experience by providing a virtual fitting room for watches.

- Video on PDP
  - Integrating a product video feature on the product detail pages of Jamtangan.com.
  - Additionally, providing an option to embed YouTube videos related to each product can enhance the overall user experience.
 
- Live Product Demos:
  - Live video to allow users to interact with hosts, ask questions, and make purchases during the live sessions.
 
- Add a button or any other element to close the popup when attempting to send OTP during login using the phone number.
  - My experience when attempting to log in with an incorrect/wrong phone number involves encountering a verification data popup to send an OTP. However, I faced difficulty in closing the popup, I had to reload the page to re-enter the correct phone number. It would be better if there is a lose button or another option to close the popup directly, so that the user does not need to reload the page and can fill in the appropriate phone number.
